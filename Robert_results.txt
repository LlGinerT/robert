Model: RF
k-neighbours-based training, validation and test sets have been created with this distribution:
Training points: 22
Validation points: 15

k-neighbours-based training: R2 = 0.97; MAE = 0.08; RMSE = 0.12
5-fold cross validation: 0.65 ± 0.22
k-neighbours-based validation: R2 = 0.96; MAE = 0.11; RMSE = 0.16
