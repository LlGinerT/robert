      Results of the VERIFY tests:
      Original score (train set for CV): RMSE = 0.32, with a +- threshold (thres_test option) of 20.0%:
         - 5-fold CV: NOT DETERMINED, data splitting was done with KN. CV result: RMSE = 0.76
      Original score (validation set): RMSE = 0.35, with a +- threshold (thres_test option) of 20.0%:
         o X_shuffle: PASSED, RMSE = 0.56 is higher than the threshold (0.42)
         o y_shuffle: PASSED, RMSE = 1.4 is higher than the threshold (0.42)
         o onehot: PASSED, RMSE = 1.1 is higher than the threshold (0.42)
