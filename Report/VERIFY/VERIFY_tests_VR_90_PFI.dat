      Results of the VERIFY tests:
      Original score (train set for CV): RMSE = 0.22, with a +- threshold (thres_test option) of 20.0%:
         - 5-fold CV: NOT DETERMINED, data splitting was done with KN. CV result: RMSE = 0.63
      Original score (validation set): RMSE = 0.36, with a +- threshold (thres_test option) of 20.0%:
         x X_shuffle: FAILED, RMSE = 0.34 is lower than the threshold (0.43)
         o y_shuffle: PASSED, RMSE = 1.5 is higher than the threshold (0.43)
         o onehot: PASSED, RMSE = 1.5 is higher than the threshold (0.43)
