      Results of the VERIFY tests:
      Original score (train set for CV): RMSE = 0.4, with a +- threshold (thres_test option) of 20.0%:
         - 5-fold CV: NOT DETERMINED, data splitting was done with KN. CV result: RMSE = 0.61
      Original score (validation set): RMSE = 0.23, with a +- threshold (thres_test option) of 20.0%:
         o X_shuffle: PASSED, RMSE = 0.51 is higher than the threshold (0.27)
         o y_shuffle: PASSED, RMSE = 0.43 is higher than the threshold (0.27)
