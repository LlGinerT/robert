Introduction
------------

.. introduction-start

ROBERT is an ensemble of automated machine learning protocols that can be run sequentially 
through a single command line. The program works for **regression and classification problems**.
Comprehensive workflows have been designed to meet state-of-the-art standards for cheminformatics 
studies, including:

   *  **Atomic and molecular descriptor generation from SMILES**, including an RDKit conformer sampling and 
      the generation of 200+ steric, electronic and structural descriptors using RDKit, xTB and DBSTEP. 
      Requires the `AQME program <https://aqme.readthedocs.io>`__.  
   *  **Data curation**, including filters for correlated descriptors, noise, and duplicates, 
      as well as conversion of categorical descriptors.  
   *  **Model selection**, including comparison of multiple hyperoptimized models from 
      scikit-learn and training sizes.  
   *  **Prediction** of external test sets, as well as SHAP and PFI feature analysis.  
   *  **VERIFY tests** to asses the predictive ability of the models, including y-shuffle
      and y-mean tests, k-fold cross-validation, and predictions with one-hot features.  

The code has been designed for:

   *  **Inexperienced researchers** in the field of ML. ROBERT workflows are fully automated, and provide 
      users with comprehensive explanations of the resulting models and their prediction reliability. 
      Moreover, ready-to-use examples and tutorials can be accessed on ReadtheDocs and YouTube. 
   *  **ML experts** aiming to automate workflows, enhance reproducibility, or save time. Entire workflows 
      can be executed using a single command line while following modern standards of reproducibility and 
      transparency. Additionally, individual ROBERT modules can be integrated into customized ML workflows.

.. installation-start

Installation
++++++++++++

In a nutshell, ROBERT and its dependencies are installed as follows:

**1.** Create and activate the conda environment where you want to install the program. If you are not sure of what 
this point means, check out the "Users with no Python experience" section. This is an example for Python 3.10, but 
it also works for other Python versions (i.e., 3.7, 3.9 and 3.11):

.. code-block:: shell 
   
   conda create -n robert python=3.10
   conda activate robert

**2.** Install ROBERT using conda-forge and the intelex accelerator with pip (only if your system is compatible with intelex) (preferred):  

.. code-block:: shell 
   
   conda install -c conda-forge robert
   pip install scikit-learn-intelex

**3.** Update ROBERT to the latest version (do not skip this step!):

.. code-block:: shell 
   
   pip install robert --upgrade

**4.** If conda-forge is too slow, users might install ROBERT using pip instead. Then, install the libraries required for report.py and the intelex accelerator (only if your system is compatible with intelex):  

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install robert
   pip install weasyprint
   conda install -c conda-forge glib gtk3 pango
   pip install scikit-learn-intelex

.. warning::

   In some HPCs, the Helvetica/Arial font used to create the report might not be installed. If the report PDF 
   looks messy, install the fonts with :code:`conda install -c conda-forge mscorefonts`.

.. note-start 

Users with no Python experience
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You need a terminal with Python to install and run ROBERT. These are some suggested first steps:  

.. |br| raw:: html

   <br />

**1.** Install `Anaconda with Python 3 <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install>`__ for your 
operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux). Alternatively, if you're familiar with conda installers, 
you can install `Miniconda with Python 3 <https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html>`__ 
(requires less space than Anaconda).  


**2.** Open an Anaconda prompt (Windows users) or a terminal (macOS and Linux).


**3.** Create a conda environment called "robert" with Python (:code:`conda create -n robert python=3.10`). 
|br|
*You only need to do this once.*
|br|
*This is an example for Python 3.10, but it also works for other Python versions (i.e., 3.7, 3.9 and 3.11).*


**4.** Activate the conda environment called "robert" (:code:`conda activate robert`).


**5.** Install ROBERT as defined in the "Installation" section (:code:`conda install -c conda-forge robert`).


**6.** Install the intelex code accelerator with pip (only if your system is compatible with intelex) (:code:`pip install scikit-learn-intelex`).


**7.** Update ROBERT to the latest version (do not skip this step!) (:code:`pip install robert --upgrade`).


**8.** Go to the folder with your CSV database (using the "cd" command, i.e. :code:`cd C:/Users/test_robert`).


**9.** Run ROBERT as explained in the Examples section.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): easyROB
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You need a terminal with Python to run easyROB, the GUI of ROBERT. This GUI simplifies the setup 
of ROBERT workflows, enabling users to select files and configure options easily. To run easyROB follow
these steps: 

**1.** Install ROBERT as defined in the "Installation" section.

.. warning::

   The GUI only works with ROBERT version 1.0.5 or later (check your version!). 

**2.** Open an Anaconda prompt (Windows users) or a terminal (macOS and Linux).


**3.** Activate the conda environment called "robert" (:code:`conda activate robert`).
