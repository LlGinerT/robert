Introduction
------------

.. introduction-start

The code is an ensemble of automated machine learning protocols that can be run through 
sequentially from a single command line. The complete workflow has been designed to meet
state-of-the-art requirements from cheminformatics studies, including:

   *  RDKit-based conformer generation from SMILES databases in CSV files, 
      followed by the generation of 200+ molecular and atomic descriptors using RDKit, 
      xTB and DBSTEP. Requires the AQME program.  
   *  Data curation, including filters for correlated descriptors, noise, and duplicates, 
      as well as conversion of categorical descriptors.  
   *  Model selection, including comparison of multiple hyperoptimized models from 
      scikit-learn and training sizes.  
   *  Prediction of external test sets, as well as SHAP and PFI feature analysis.  
   *  Statistical tests to asses the predictive ability of the models, including y-shuffle
      and y-mean tests, k-fold cross-validation, and predictions with one-hot features.

Installation
++++++++++++

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Check our `ROBERT installation in 2 mins <https://youtu.be/VeaBzqIZHbo>`_ video 
for a quick installation guide. In a nutshell, ROBERT and its dependencies are 
installed as follows:

1. Install ROBERT using conda-forge and, if possible, install the intelex sklearn accelerator (preferred):  

.. code-block:: shell 
   
   conda install -c conda-forge robert
   conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn-intelex 

2. Install ROBERT using pip and, if possible, install the intelex sklearn accelerator. Then, install the libraries required for report.py with conda-forge:  

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install robert
   pip install scikit-learn-intelex
   conda install -c conda-forge glib weasyprint gtk3 pango

.. installation-end 

.. update-start 

Update to the latest version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Update to the latest version with pip (preferred):  

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install robert --upgrade

2. Download the code from GitHub, go to the main robert folder in your terminal (contains the setup.py file), and:  

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install .

.. update-end 

.. note-start 

Quick note for users with no Python experience
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You need a terminal with Python to install and run ROBERT. These are some suggested first steps:  

**For Windows users:**

1. Install `Anaconda with Python 3 <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/>`__.  

2. Open an Anaconda prompt.

3. Install ROBERT as defined above (:code:`conda install -c conda-forge robert`).

4. Go to the folder with your CSV database (using the "cd" command, i.e. :code:`cd C:/Users/test_robert`).

5. Run ROBERT as explained in the Examples section.

**For macOS and Linux users:**

1. Open a terminal with Python.

2. Install ROBERT as defined above (:code:`conda install -c conda-forge robert`).

3. Go to the folder with your CSV database (using the "cd" command, i.e. :code:`cd C:/Users/test_robert`).

4. Run ROBERT as explained in the Examples section.

Features and modules
--------------------

AQME
++++++

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Module used to curate the data from CSV databases. Protocols included:

   *  Filters off correlated descriptors
   *  Filters off variables with very low correlation to the target values (noise)
   *  Filters off duplicates
   *  Converts categorical descriptors into one-hot descriptors  

CURATE
++++++

Module used to curate the data from CSV databases. Protocols included:

   *  Filters off correlated descriptors
   *  Filters off variables with very low correlation to the target values (noise)
   *  Filters off duplicates
   *  Converts categorical descriptors into one-hot descriptors  

GENERATE
++++++++

Module used to screen multiple hyperoptimized ML models and select the best models. 
Protocols performed:  

   *  Hyperoptimization of models  
   *  Filter off descriptors with low permutance feature importance (PFI). New 
      models are generated parallely, (1) No PFI and (2) PFI-filtered models.  
   *  Creation of a heatmap plot with different model types and partition sizes. One 
      plot is generated for No PFI models and another for PFI-filtered models.  
   *  Selection and storage of the best No PFI and PFI models.  

PREDICT
+++++++

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Module used to load the best models obtained with GENERATE and perform new predictions, 
as well as descriptor and outlier analysis. Protocols included:  

   *  Gaussian  
   *  ORCA  
   *  pySCF (loading parameters in jupyter notebook)  


VERIFY
++++++

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX cclib-based analyzer of output files from multiple QM programs. This module:  

   *  Separates normally terminated files with no errors, extra imaginary 
      frequencies, duplicates, isomerization to other systems and spin contamination  
   *  Automatically generates new com files to "fix" the different issues 
      of the calculations with strategies that are optimal for each type of issue 
      (Gaussian and ORCA)  
   *  Checks that all the calculations are homogeneous (i.e. using the 
      same level of theory, same grid size, same program and version, 
      solvation model, etc)
