A full ROBERT workflow using the Robert_examples.csv database. To run the workflow:

1) Go to the folder with the databases in a terminal with Python
2) Run the following command lines:

--- For the standard full workflow ---
python -m robert --ignore "[Name]" --names Name --y Target_values --csv_name Robert_example.csv

The results of the workflow are stored in the /Examples/CSV_workflow/Results folder. A Jupyter Notebook to run the standard full workflow is also included.

A SLURM script (csv_workflow_SLURM.sh) is also provided to run the workflow in HPCs.

A full description of the workflow is included in the Examples section of the ReadTheDocs webpage (https://robert.readthedocs.io).
